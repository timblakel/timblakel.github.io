    <h1>Interactive Bezier Curve</h1>

    <p>Click and drage the blue points to change the curve.</p>

    <blockquote>
        "Four points P0, P1, P2 and P3 in the plane or in higher-dimensional 
        space define a cubic BÃ©zier curve. The curve starts at P0 going toward P1 and 
        arrives at P3 coming from the direction of P2. Usually, it will not pass through 
        P1 or P2; these points are only there to provide directional information. 
        The distance between P1 and P2 determines "how far" and "how fast" the curve moves 
        towards P1 before turning towards P2."
