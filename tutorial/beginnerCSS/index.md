I followed the [HTML Dog beginner CSS tutorial](https://htmldog.com/guides/css/beginner/). The result was this basic page: [https://timblakel.github.io/tutorial/beginnerCSS/firstpage.html](https://timblakel.github.io/tutorial/beginnerCSS/firstpage.html)  
The tutorial covers the basics of CSS for people that have no prior experience. The tutorial includes discussion on how to apply CSS (i.e. inline, internal, and external), selectors, properties, values, colors, margins/padding, borders, etc.
