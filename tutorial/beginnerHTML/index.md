I followed the [HTML Dog beginner HTML tutorial](https://htmldog.com/guides/html/beginner/). The result was this basic page: [https://timblakel.github.io/tutorial/beginnerHTML/firstpage.html](https://timblakel.github.io/tutorial/beginnerHTML/firstpage.html)  
The tutorial covered the basics of HTML for an audience (me) that has no prior experience. This included an explanation of tags, attributes, and elements as well as how to set up a page with lists, links, images, tables, and forms.
